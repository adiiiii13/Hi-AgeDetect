# Hand Wave and Age Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand waving gestures and estimate age from face images in real-time using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- **Hand Wave Detection:** Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and identify waving gestures.
- **Age Estimation:** Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to estimate the age of individuals detected in the frame.
- **Voice Feedback:** Provides voice feedback using pyttsx3 when a hand wave is detected.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adiiiii13/Hi-AgeDetect
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyttsx3
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Hi+AgeDetect.py
   ```
   
2. Wave your hand in front of the camera to trigger the "Hi!" message and voice feedback.

## Credits

This project was inspired by tutorials and examples found on ChatGPT, GitHub repositories, and YouTube channels. While not entirely original, it serves as a practical demonstration of integrating hand gesture recognition and age estimation using popular libraries and models.
